# responsive-nav-scss
Responsive and animated navigation sample using only styles (no JS involved). SCSS used clarity and efficiency.

## Credit where due

This sample uses an idea I first saw in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA&t=1474s) to toggle the state of navigation with a checkbox input. I can't be 100% sure, since this is now a widely used solution, but I think it might have originated with [Traversy Media's HTML course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZg6UfS5zYg&t=1597s)? I highly recommend both these videos :ok_hand:
